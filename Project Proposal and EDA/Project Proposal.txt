TITLE OF THE PROJECT: Factors that contribute to the success of a soccer team: wage distribution, skill or type of player?

Soccer teams with star players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo has greatly imbalance distribution of wage. With no surprise, teams like these are 
also very successful in terms of matches result. At the same time, there are also successful teams with a much more balance wage distribution. Therefore, 
we are interested to see how chance of winning a match is affected by the distribution of wage, and can we reliably predict it? In addition we want to see
what type of players, in terms of 1. skills (denote by attrs) and 2. role, contribute most to the chance of winning.

With this project we hope to be able to better explain the income inequalities in football teams. And by looking at some additional factors, we want to help 
teams make better investment by deciding what type of players should they focus on more
