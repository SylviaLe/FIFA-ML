# Predicting Football Match Result

Machine learning models built using Python to predict the result of a football match, base on the teams and players statistics. Datasets used to train and test the models are retrived on Kaggle.

The probability of correctly random-guess the outcome of a match is 33.33%. The KNN model can have the accuracy up to 51%, which are close to the result obtained by previous research.
